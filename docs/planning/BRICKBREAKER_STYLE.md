# AMS-based Brickbreaker variant
Standard brickbreaker layout (grid of bricks at top of screen, bouncing ball (variable speed) and paddle)

## Interaction Modes
### Stopping paddle (easier)
- laser: hit "move left/right" buttons to slide paddle, turn laser off to stop paddle
- blaster/arrows: shoot where you want the center of the paddle to go, it will slide to there and stop

### Continuous paddle (hard)
- all modes: hit "move left/right" buttons to change direction
- variants: paddle bounces off walls, paddle continuously moves around (going off left means it emerges from right - configurable "dead" time where the paddle is offscreen, to increase difficulty -- rewards keeping the paddle on screen

## Difficulty levels
 - ball speed
 - paddle speed
 - variable brick types
     - require multiple hits to destroy
