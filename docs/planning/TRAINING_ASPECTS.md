# Training Aspects Coverage

This document maps the cognitive and biomechanical skills trained by each game, identifies gaps, and guides future game development to ensure comprehensive skill coverage.

## Training Philosophy

**Primary Focus: Instinctive Accuracy**

The current game suite emphasizes building instinctive accuracy - the ability to hit what you're looking at without conscious aiming. This is the foundation of practical archery skill and transfers to other targeting activities.

### The Problem with Repetition-Based Training

Traditional training emphasizes repetition: shoot the same target from the same distance until you "groove" the motion. This builds context-dependent skill that often fails to transfer to real-world conditions.

**Why repetition fails:**
- Creates muscle memory tied to specific conditions
- Doesn't develop adaptation or problem-solving
- Boring - leads to mindless practice rather than engaged learning
- Real situations are never identical to practice conditions
- Builds false confidence that crumbles under novel circumstances

**What real-world performance requires:**
- Hitting targets at varied distances, angles, positions
- Adapting to changing conditions (lighting, fatigue, pressure)
- Making decisions (which target, when to shoot, shoot/no-shoot)
- Performing without warm-up or ideal setup
- Executing under time pressure or stress

### Variable Practice Over Repetition

This platform is built on the principle of **variable practice** - every attempt presents a fresh problem. Each shot requires:
- New target acquisition (different position)
- Fresh distance/angle calculation
- Active engagement (can't go on autopilot)
- Decision-making (what to prioritize)

Research consistently shows variable practice produces better transfer to novel situations, even though it feels harder during training and may show slower initial improvement.

### Design Principles

Instinctive accuracy develops through:
1. **High volume of varied attempts** - Variable practice, never the same shot twice
2. **Immediate feedback** - Know instantly if you hit or missed
3. **Progressive challenge** - Difficulty that scales with skill
4. **Deliberate focus** - Quality shots, not rushed attempts
5. **Realistic complexity** - Multiple targets, movement, time pressure, decisions
6. **Engagement over grind** - Games should be interesting enough to maintain focus

## Coverage Gaps

### Well Covered (Current Focus)
- ✅ Repeatability (Grouping)
- ✅ Fine Motor Control (Grouping)
- ✅ Target Transitions (ManyTargets)
- ✅ Full-Field Coverage (ManyTargets)
- ✅ Inhibition Control (ManyTargets strict)
- ✅ Basic Tracking (BalloonPop, DuckHunt)

### Not Covered (Future Opportunities)
- ❌ **Discrimination** - No shoot/no-shoot decisions *(solvable: add decoys to DuckHunt)*
- ❌ **Speed/Accuracy Tradeoff** - No risk/reward decision on shot timing *(planned: variable scoring by time-of-flight)*
- ❌ **Scanning/Search** - No hidden or cluttered targets
- ❌ **Pattern Memory** - No Simon-says style recall
- ❌ **Endurance** - No long-session fatigue training
- ❌ **Erratic Movement** - Only predictable paths *(solvable: add variation to flight paths, temporary occlusion behind obstacles (trees))*

## Future Game Concepts by Gap

### Discrimination
**DuckHunt Enhancement: Decoy Targets**
- Add non-target birds (protected species, decoys)
- Hitting decoy = major penalty or round end
- Speed progression means less time to identify
- Combines: tracking + timing + target ID
- Low implementation effort - extends existing game

**Alternative: Friend or Foe (standalone)**
- Mix of valid targets and "don't shoot" elements
- Hitting wrong target = major penalty
- Tests target identification under pressure
- Trains shoot/no-shoot decisions

### Speed/Accuracy Tradeoff
**Growing Targets**
- Target appears small and grows over time
- Score = inverse of size when hit (smaller = more points)
- Natural risk/reward - wait for easy shot or take the hard one early
- Miss penalty prevents spray-and-pray
- Trains: confidence, quick acquisition, "send it" mentality
- No artificial timer - the mechanic itself creates speed pressure
- Variants: multiple targets, shrink after peak, variable growth rates

### Scanning/Search
**Hidden Targets**
- Targets blend into background or clutter
- Must find before you can hit
- Trains visual search patterns
- Could use camouflage or partial occlusion

### Decision Speed
**Priority Targets**
- Multiple targets with different values/urgency
- Must choose optimal target quickly
- Time pressure forces fast decisions
- Risk/reward tradeoffs

### Pattern Memory
**Sequence Recall**
- Targets light up in sequence
- Must hit in same order
- Increasing sequence length
- Memory + accuracy combined

### Endurance
**Marathon Mode**
- Extended session (10+ minutes)
- Tracks accuracy degradation over time
- Identifies when fatigue affects performance
- Could be added to any existing game

### Erratic Movement
**Evasive Targets**
- Targets that change direction unpredictably
- Acceleration/deceleration
- Requires true tracking, not pattern prediction

## Design Principles for Training Games

1. **Variable Practice** - Each attempt should be different
2. **Immediate Feedback** - Know results instantly
3. **Measurable Progress** - Quantifiable improvement
4. **Appropriate Challenge** - Hard enough to require focus, not so hard it's frustrating
