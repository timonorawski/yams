# Trajectory algorithm selection
trajectory:
  algorithm: "linear"  # Linear horizontal movement
  depth_direction: "away"  # Required field (but no depth scaling used for linear)
  curvature_factor: 0.0  # Straight lines only

# Pacing configuration (optional - for multi-device support)
pacing:
  spawn_interval: 2.0      # Base seconds between target spawns
  target_lifetime: 5.0     # Seconds before target escapes
  max_active: 3            # Max simultaneous targets
  combo_window: 5.0        # Seconds before combo resets
  combo_threshold: 5       # Hits needed to start combo

# Spawn configuration
spawning:
  spawn_sides: ["left", "right"]  # Horizontal spawn from edges
  spawn_rate_base: 2.0  # Seconds between spawns (TARGET_SPAWN_RATE)
  max_active: 3  # Max simultaneous targets (TARGET_MAX_ACTIVE)

# Win/Loss conditions
rules:
  game_type: "endless"  # Endless mode (no win condition)
  # Optional: score_target: null
  # Optional: max_misses: null
  # Optional: time_limit: null

# Per-level difficulty progression
# This mode uses continuous difficulty scaling (not discrete levels)
# but we can represent it as progression levels
levels:
  - level: 1
    target:
      size: 50.0  # TARGET_DEFAULT_SIZE
      speed: 80.0  # CLASSIC_INITIAL_SPEED
      depth_range: [1.0, 1.01]  # Minimal depth variation (essentially 2D)
    trajectory:
      algorithm: "linear"
      depth_direction: "away"
      curvature_factor: 0.0  # Straight lines
    spawning:
      spawn_sides: ["left", "right"]
      spawn_rate_base: 2.0  # TARGET_SPAWN_RATE
      max_active: 3  # TARGET_MAX_ACTIVE
    progression:
      speed_increase_per_hit: 10.0  # CLASSIC_SPEED_INCREASE
      max_speed: 300.0  # CLASSIC_MAX_SPEED

  # Note: This mode uses continuous difficulty scaling rather than discrete levels
  # The speed increases by 10 px/s per hit up to 300 px/s max
  # Additional levels not needed since progression is continuous

# Scoring configuration
scoring:
  base_hit_points: 100  # POINTS_PER_HIT
  combo_multiplier: true  # Combo system enabled
  combo_threshold: 5  # Combo milestone for audio feedback
  miss_penalty: 0  # PENALTY_PER_MISS
  speed_bonus: false  # No speed-based scoring
  apex_bonus: 0  # No apex bonus (no curved trajectories)

# Target lifetime
target:
  lifetime: 5.0  # CLASSIC_TARGET_LIFETIME (seconds before escape)
  hit_display_time: 0.5  # How long hit targets remain visible

# Visual/Audio feedback
feedback:
  hit_effect_duration: 0.5  # HIT_EFFECT_DURATION
  miss_effect_duration: 0.3  # MISS_EFFECT_DURATION
  score_popup_duration: 1.0  # SCORE_POPUP_DURATION
  audio_enabled: true  # Audio feedback enabled by default
