description: "Practice mode for archery with 6 arrows per round. Designed for physical archery systems where the archer must collect arrows between rounds."
author: "ArcheryGame Team"
unlock_requirement: 0  # Available from start

# Visual theme
theme: "classic"

# Trajectory algorithm - bezier curves with 3D depth
trajectory:
  algorithm: "bezier_3d"
  depth_direction: "away"  # Targets fly away from camera
  curvature_factor: 1.0

# Spawn configuration
spawning:
  spawn_sides: ["left", "right"]
  spawn_rate_base: 3.0  # One target every 3 seconds
  max_active: 2  # Max 2 targets on screen at once

# Win/Loss conditions
rules:
  game_type: "endless"  # Endless practice mode
  projectiles_per_round: 6  # 6 arrows per round (realistic archery constraint)
  # When arrows are depleted, game transitions to WAITING_FOR_RELOAD state
  # AMS will handle interstitial screen (e.g., "Collect your arrows")
