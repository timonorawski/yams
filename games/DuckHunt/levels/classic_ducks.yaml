# Trajectory algorithm selection
trajectory:
  algorithm: "bezier_3d"  # 3D curved trajectories with depth simulation
  depth_direction: "away"  # Ducks fly away from player (receding)
  curvature_factor: 1.0  # Full parabolic curves (0.0 = straight line, 1.0 = full curve)

# Pacing configuration (optional - for multi-device support)
pacing:
  spawn_interval: 2.5      # Base seconds between target spawns
  target_lifetime: 6.0     # Seconds before target escapes
  max_active: 3            # Max simultaneous targets
  combo_window: 5.0        # Seconds before combo resets
  combo_threshold: 3       # Hits needed to start combo

# Spawn configuration
spawning:
  spawn_sides: ["left", "right"]  # Where targets can spawn
  spawn_rate_base: 2.0  # Base seconds between spawns
  max_active: 3  # Max simultaneous targets

# Win/Loss conditions
rules:
  game_type: "endless"  # Endless mode with progressive difficulty
  # Optional: score_target: 50
  # Optional: max_misses: 10
  # Optional: time_limit: 120
