# Pasture

This directory contains work-in-progress files, experimental code, and deprecated implementations that have been moved out of the active codebase but preserved for reference.

## Contents

### duckhunt-wip/
Demo scripts and ad-hoc test files from DuckHunt development:
- `demo_*.py` - Development demo scripts
- `test_*.py` - Ad-hoc testing scripts (not part of pytest suite)
- `models_old.py` - Deprecated models before refactoring to `/models/`

## Why "Pasture"?

These files have been "put out to pasture" - they're no longer actively maintained but may contain useful reference code or ideas for future work.

## Restoring Files

If you need to restore any of these files to active development:
1. Move them back to their original location
2. Update any imports that may have changed
3. Run tests to ensure compatibility with current codebase
